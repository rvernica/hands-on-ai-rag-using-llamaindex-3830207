Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at\\r\\nIllinois Benedictine College (the \"Project\").  Among other\\r\\nthings, this means that no one owns a United States copyright\\r\\non or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and\\r\\ndistribute it in the United States without permission and\\r\\nwithout paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth\\r\\nbelow, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext\\r\\nunder the Project\\'s \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create these etexts, the Project expends considerable\\r\\nefforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain\\r\\nworks.  Despite these efforts, the Project\\'s etexts and any\\r\\nmedium they may be on may contain \"Defects\".  Among other\\r\\nthings, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or\\r\\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\\r\\nintellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged\\r\\ndisk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer\\r\\ncodes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES\\r\\nBut for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described below,\\r\\n[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this\\r\\netext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including\\r\\nlegal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR\\r\\nUNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,\\r\\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\\r\\nOR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE\\r\\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of\\r\\nreceiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)\\r\\nyou paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that\\r\\ntime to the person you received it from.  If you received it\\r\\non a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and\\r\\nsuch person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement\\r\\ncopy.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢‚Äôs\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation‚Äôs EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state‚Äôs laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation‚Äôs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation‚Äôs website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
