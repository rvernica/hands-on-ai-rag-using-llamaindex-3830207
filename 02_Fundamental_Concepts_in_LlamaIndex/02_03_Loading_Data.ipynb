KENNEDY'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS ***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn F. Kennedy‚Äôs Inaugural Address, January 20, 1961, 12:11 EST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of\\r\\nfreedom‚Äîsymbolizing an end as well as a beginning‚Äîsignifying renewal as\\r\\nwell as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same\\r\\nsolemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters\\r\\nago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the\\r\\npower to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human\\r\\nlife. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears\\r\\nfought are still at issue around the globe‚Äîthe belief that the rights\\r\\nof man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of\\r\\nGod.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first\\r\\nrevolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend\\r\\nand foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of\\r\\nAmericans‚Äîborn in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard\\r\\nand bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage‚Äîand unwilling to\\r\\nwitness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this\\r\\nnation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today\\r\\nat home and around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall\\r\\npay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,\\r\\noppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis much we pledge‚Äîand more.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share: we\\r\\npledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we\\r\\ncannot do in a host of co-operative ventures. Divided, there is little\\r\\nwe can do‚Äîfor we dare not meet a powerful challenge, at odds, and split\\r\\nasunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free: we pledge\\r\\nour word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away\\r\\nmerely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always\\r\\nexpect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to\\r\\nfind them strongly supporting their own freedom‚Äîand to remember that,\\r\\nin the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the\\r\\ntiger ended up inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling\\r\\nto break the bonds of mass misery: we pledge our best efforts to help\\r\\nthem help themselves, for whatever period is required‚Äînot because the\\r\\nCommunists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but\\r\\nbecause it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are\\r\\npoor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo our sister republics south of our border: we offer a special\\r\\npledge‚Äîto convert our good words into good deeds‚Äîn a new alliance for\\r\\nprogress‚Äîto assist free men and free governments in casting off the\\r\\nchains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become\\r\\nthe prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall\\r\\njoin with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the\\r\\nAmericas And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to\\r\\nremain the master of its own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states: the United Nations, our\\r\\nlast best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced\\r\\nthe instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support‚Äîto prevent it\\r\\nfrom becoming merely a forum for invective‚Äîto strengthen its shield of\\r\\nthe new and the weak‚Äîand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries, we\\r\\noffer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest\\r\\nfor peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science\\r\\nengulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are\\r\\nsufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will\\r\\nnever be employed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort\\r\\nfrom our present course‚Äîboth sides overburdened by the cost of modern\\r\\nweapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom,\\r\\nyet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays\\r\\nthe hand of Mankind‚Äôs final war.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us begin anew‚Äîremembering on both sides that civility is not a\\r\\nsign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us\\r\\nnever negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\\r\\nthose problems which divide us.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise\\r\\nproposals for the inspection and control of arms‚Äîand bring the absolute\\r\\npower to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all\\r\\nnations.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its\\r\\nterrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts,\\r\\neradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and\\r\\ncommerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of\\r\\nIsaiah‚Äîto ‚Äúundo the heavy burdens. . . let the oppressed go free.‚Äù\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of\\r\\nsuspicion, let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power,\\r\\nbut a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure\\r\\nand the peace preserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will\\r\\nit be finished in the first one thousand days. . . nor in the life of\\r\\nthis administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.\\r\\nBut let us begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final\\r\\nsuccess or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each\\r\\ngeneration of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its\\r\\nnational loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call\\r\\nto service surround the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the trumpet summons us again‚Äînot as a call to bear arms, though\\r\\narms we need‚Äînot as a call to battle, though embattled we are‚Äîbut a\\r\\ncall to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year\\r\\nout, ‚Äúrejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation‚Äù‚Äîa struggle against the\\r\\ncommon enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North\\r\\nand South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all\\r\\nmankind? Will you join in that historic effort?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been\\r\\ngranted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I\\r\\ndo not shrink from this responsibility‚ÄîI welcome it. I do not believe\\r\\nthat any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other\\r\\ngeneration. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this\\r\\nendeavor will light our country and all who serve it‚Äîand the glow from\\r\\nthat fire can truly light the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for\\r\\nyou‚Äîask what you can do for your country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you,\\r\\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\\r\\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which\\r\\nwe ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with\\r\\nhistory the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead the land\\r\\nwe love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on\\r\\nearth God‚Äôs work must truly be our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JOHN F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢‚Äôs\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation‚Äôs EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state‚Äôs laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation‚Äôs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation‚Äôs website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",
