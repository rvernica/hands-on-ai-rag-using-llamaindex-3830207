His victory at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE solidified his control over the Persian Empire.\n",

      "1. **Westbound Departures**:\n",
      "   - Due to the proximity to San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) and the San Francisco Class B airspace, westbound departures from KPAO typically involve a south or southeast turn shortly after takeoff.\n",
      "   - Aircraft may depart towards the San Mateo County coastline or parallel the I-280 freeway towards the Half Moon Bay Airport (KHAF) or further south.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Southbound Departures**:\n",
      "   - Departing to the south from KPAO, aircraft often follow the Bayshore Freeway (US-101) towards the San Jose International Airport (KSJC) or continue further south towards the South County Airport of Santa Clara (E16).\n",
      "   - Another common route is to follow the Caltrain commuter rail line towards Mountain View, then proceed to Morgan Hill (E14) or Hollister (CVH).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Eastbound Departures**:\n",
      "   - Eastbound departures from KPAO usually involve a climb to cross the Santa Cruz Mountains. A common route is to follow the I-280 freeway towards Los Gatos, then turn east towards the South Valley Airport (E15) in San Martin or further east towards the Central Valley.\n",
      "   - Another option is to fly north along the San Francisco Bay shoreline, then turn east towards Livermore (KLVK) or Byron (C83).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Northbound Departures**:\n",
      "   - Northbound departures are typically less common due to the proximity to San Francisco Class B airspace and the restricted airspace over Moffett Federal Airfield (KNUQ).\n",
      "   - However, some northbound departures may involve flying along the Bay shoreline towards the Oakland International Airport (KOAK) or following the I-680 freeway corridor towards the Hayward Executive Airport (KHWD) and further north.\n",
