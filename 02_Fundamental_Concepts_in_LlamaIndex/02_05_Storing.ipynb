The recreant\\r\\nor the dreamer complains that he has no real chance. He would succeed,\\r\\nhe says, if he had but the implements of success--money, influence,\\r\\nsocial prestige, and the like. But success lies far less in implements\\r\\nthan in the use we make of them. What one man throws away as useless,\\r\\nanother man seizes as the best means of victory at hand. For every one\\r\\nof us the materials for achievement are sufficient. The spirit that\\r\\nprompts us is what ultimately counts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:--\\r\\n  There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;\\r\\n  And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged\\r\\n  A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords\\r\\n  Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince\\'s banner\\r\\n  Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.\\r\\n  A craven hung along the battle\\'s edge,\\r\\n  And thought, \"Had I a sword of keener steel--\\r\\n  That blue blade that the king\\'s son bears,--but this\\r\\n  Blunt thing--!\" he snapt and flung it from his hand,\\r\\n  And lowering crept away and left the field.\\r\\n  Then came the king\\'s son, wounded, sore bestead,\\r\\n  And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,\\r\\n  Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,\\r\\n  And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout\\r\\n  Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,\\r\\n  And saved a great cause that heroic day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Edward Rowland Sill._\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom \"Poems.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough dogs persist in barking at the moon, the moon\\'s business is not\\r\\nto answer the dogs or to waste strength placating them, but simply to\\r\\nshine.
